# LEGO-Torch

This is a pet project build upon pytorch, everytime I write a pytorch network, it is inevitable that I have to re-write everything, such as optimizer, scheduler, args, tensorboard and etc. So one idea came up in my mind:  to write a fixed pipeline that only require a custom dataset, a model and a tensorboard display strategy.
